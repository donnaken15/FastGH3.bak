[FixD3DWindowFrame]
help="Tries to prevent D3D from rendering on the whole window surface including the window border. It activates a small trick that cause the program to render to a child modal surface within the main window borders."
[NoD3DWindowMove]
help="Do not try to update the window position and size on D3D rendering. In some cases, the window may be movable but the rendering area does not move with it. In this case, avoid moving the window at all. It is an experimental feature and doesn't always work."
[MakeBackbufferAttachable]
help="Alters the size specification of the created backbuffer so that it copes with the actual primary surface, so that it may be attachable to a ZBUFFER surface. It makes "Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX" playable."
[BlitFromBackbuffer]
help="Some games (the Sims, the only one so far....) read graphic data from the primary surface. When the game runs windowed, the approximation introduced in a scaled window brings cumulative error that appear as a progressive smearing effect. In this case, it might be better to read the data from the backbuffer surface that is not scaled, even if in such a way you get other troubles when scrolling (see it by yourself...). The only reasonable alternative: write game code in a better way, in my opinion!"
[NoSystemMemoryOnPrimary]
help="DirectDraw applications have much better performance if they can operate on system memory rather than video memory, particularly when reading surface memory. Since the virtual primary surface has to be read before it can be transferred to the actual primary surface, it's best to use system memory offscreen surfaces whenever possible. Unfortunately, some programs request hardware acceleration functions that are only available for video surfaces. This flag forces the virtual primary surface to be created in system memory, sacrificing performance for compatibility."
[NoSystemMemoryOnBackbuffer]
help="Similar to the NoSystemMemoryOnPrimary tweak, but applied to the backbuffer surface. It's rare to need both of these flags, and which one to use depends on where the application performs the accelerated functions."
[AllowSysMemoryOn3DDevices]
help="Forces the usage of system memory on ZBUFFER surface"
[ReturnNULLReference]
help="Always return a 0 reference counter when a surface or DirectDraw session is released."
[ForcesHEL]
help="Forces Hardware Emulation Layer."
[LockColorDepth]
help="Prevents ddraw emulation to change the virtual color depth. Useful so far only with Ahlgrens Bisplet"
[FixParentWindow]
help="Typically, a game is started with an invisible program window, and then it creates a separate child window for handling the graphics. Some games use the parent window instead of the child window. In this case, the parent window becomes visible, then needs to be properly resized. This feature is currently experimental, but it seems to successfully manage several tough games, such as Solaris, SleepWalker, Sid Meier's Sim Golf, and the Worms series."
[MouseMoveByEvent]
help="Replaces the SetCursorPos system call with a mouse_event call that is better tolerated by certain games, e.g. "Wind Fantasy II""
[NoMainWindowDestruction]
help="Some games kill the main window before starting a new one, and DxWnd may not properly handle this behavior. This flag prevents the main window from being destroyed, resolving that issue."
[SendWM_ACTIVATEAPPMessage]
help="Windows sends an ACTIVATEAPP message to fullscreen programs, but may not send this message to windowed programs. This flag forces Windows to send that message, resolving cases where the hooked program expects to receive such a message."
[LegacyD3DResolutionHack]
help="Eliminates some maximum resolution checks within the D3D implementation"
[FixAILSoundLocks]
help="experimental - not working"
[SuppressIME]
help="Attempts to destroy the IME window created by the DWM Desktop Manager"
[FPSCountUpdatesBigger1/4Screen]
help="DxWnd can display an FPS counter based on the number of screen updates per second. This counter is accurate for applications that update the entire screen, but produces wildly exaggerated figures when a program makes frequent updates to small sections of the screen, such as counters, icons, or other tiny elements. This flag tells DxWnd to ignore screen updates that affect less than one quarter of the screen, producing a more realistic FPS figure."
[MakeQueriedWindowVisible]
help="Makes visible any window that is queried for its visibility status"
[FixEmpireOfTheFadingSuns]
help="Runtime patch for "Emperor of the Fading Suns" that clears a memory area responsible to inhibit ddraw blits to primary surface. It's a quick & dirty way to make the game running ok."
[KillBlackWindows]
help="Prevents the creation of annoying windows such as black background windows used to cover the desktop, but undesireable in windowed mode. Such windows are identified by window name or class, so they have to be included in a DxWnd internal list."
[ZeroDisplayCounter]
help="Forces a 0 return code in ShowCursor(FALSE) call. Fixes a bad loop conrol in "Cottage of  Leopold the Cat" game."
[ReplaceDialogs]
help="Replaces troublesome dialog windows where the program blits some graphic with more manageable plain windows."
[ManageFourCCSurfaces]
help="Allows handling of FourCC YUY2 surfaces by forcing Flip operation to bypass the emulation layer and blit directly on the video surface. This makes some movies visible."
